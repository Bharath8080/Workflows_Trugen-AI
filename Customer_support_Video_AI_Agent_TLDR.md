This n8n template creates a high-performance AI operations agent designed for service platforms. Optimized for **Trugen AI**'s high-performance, low-latency voice and video interfaces, it handles user requests with intelligent reasoning and multi-tool integration, ensuring a professional and seamless support experience.

- **Interprets Intent**: Uses an AI Agent with specialized reasoning to decide between answering questions or scheduling appointments.
- **Retrieves Knowledge**: Searches your Google Sheets database for service details, pricing, or platform info.
- **Schedules Meetings**: Checks real-time availability and creates events in Google Calendar (with IST timezone support).
- **Sends Confirmations**: Automatically triggers a Gmail notification once a booking is successfully completed.
- **Low-Latency Interaction**: Powered by **Trugen AI** for near-instant responses in voice and video conversations.
