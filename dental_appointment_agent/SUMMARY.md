# Create a dental appointment handling agent with GPT-4.1 mini and Calendar booking

This n8n template creates a high-performance clinical operations agent designed for dental practices. Optimized for **Trugen AI**'s low-latency voice and video interfaces, it handles patient requests with medical reasoning and multi-tool integration, ensuring a professional and HIPAA-compliant scheduling experience.

## 👥 Who is this for?

- **Dental Clinics** wanting to provide 24/7 automated booking and patient intake.
- **Private Practices** looking to reduce staff workload on managing calendars.
- **Medical AI Developers** building conversational healthcare agents on Trugen AI.
- **Office Managers** aiming to streamline patient inquiries and insurance logging.

## 💡 What problem is this workflow solving?

Medical and dental front offices often struggle with:

- **After-Hours Calls**: Potential patients unable to book when the office is closed.
- **Scheduling Friction**: Manual back-and-forth to find available timeslots on a busy calendar.
- **Patient Onboarding**: Administrative time spent collecting insurance and contact details.

This workflow solves these by using **OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini** reasoning to intelligently check **Google Calendar** availability (CST/IST), book appointments, and capture patient records in **Google Sheets** automatically.

## ⚙️ What this workflow does

- **Captures Intent**: Receives patient voice/video transcriptions via a secure Webhook from Trugen AI.
- **Checks Availability**: Decides when to query Google Calendar for at least 2 available timeslots in the requested window.
- **Books Appointments**: Creates 1-hour dental sessions directly in the clinic calendar once a slot is confirmed.
- **Logs Patient Data**: Captures and logs insurance providers, patient questions, and contact details to a master spreadsheet.
- **Responds to Patient**: Returns a structured confirmation to the Trugen agent to provide instant feedback to the user.
- **Timezone Awareness**: Handles scheduling logic in the clinic's local timezone (CST) for accuracy.

## 🧰 Setup

- **OpenAI**: Connect your API key (optimized for GPT-4.1 mini).
- **Google Workspace**: Enable and connect Google Sheets and Google Calendar.
- **Calendar ID**: Select the correct target calendar in the `get_availability` and `create_appointment` nodes.
- **Database**: Connect the `log_patient_details` node to your "Pearly Whites" patient spreadsheet.
- **Webhook**: Replace the Webhook URL in your Trugen AI agent settings with the one generated by this workflow.

## 🛠️ How to customize this workflow

- **Clinic Hours**: Update the AI Agent system prompt with your specific business hours and lunch breaks.
- **Appointment Types**: Customize the reasoning to handle different durations (e.g., 30m for cleaning, 90m for surgery).
- **Pre-screening**: Add health questionnaire logic to the system prompt to pre-screen patients before booking.
- **Reminders**: Add a SMS node (like Twilio) to send the patient a text confirmation after the booking is logged.
