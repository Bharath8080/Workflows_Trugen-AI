# Create an HR screening voice & video agent with GPT-4o-mini and Google Sheets logging

This n8n template creates a high-performance HR recruitment agent designed for high-volume candidate screening. Optimized for **Trugen AI**'s low-latency voice and video interfaces, it handles initial screening interviews with intelligent reasoning and automated data logging, ensuring a professional and efficient recruitment process.

## 👥 Who is this for?

- **Recruitment Agencies** managing high candidate volumes for professional roles.
- **HR Departments** looking to automate initial screening and qualification steps.
- **AI Developers** building clinical or professional interview agents on Trugen AI.
- **Talent Acquisition Teams** aiming to reduce manual data entry and scoring tasks.

## 💡 What problem is this workflow solving?

Traditional recruitment screening often suffers from:

- **Volume Bottlenecks**: HR teams spending hundreds of hours on basic qualification calls.
- **Subjective Assessment**: Inconsistent scoring and documentation across different screeners.
- **Manual Data Entry**: Slow data transfer from voice notes to spreadsheets or ATS systems.

This workflow solves these by using **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** reasoning to conduct structured interviews, extract key candidate details (skills, salary, notice period), and log objective scores to **Google Sheets** automatically.

## ⚙️ What this workflow does

- **Captures Input**: Receives live candidate voice/video transcriptions via a secure Webhook from Trugen AI.
- **Analyzes Qualifications**: Uses an AI Agent to extract specific data points like technical skills, experience levels, and logistics.
- **Scores Candidates**: Evaluates candidate responses against pre-defined job requirements to assign an objective qualification score.
- **Logs Screening Data**: Automatically records the full candidate profile and screening results in a master Google Sheets spreadsheet.
- **Professional Interaction**: Powered by **Trugen AI** for natural, human-like voice and video interaction during the screening.

## 🧰 Setup

- **OpenAI**: Connect your API key (optimized for GPT-4o-mini).
- **Google Workspace**: Enable and connect Google Sheets.
- **Database**: Update the `documentId` in the Google Sheets node to point to your recruitment tracker.
- **Webhook**: Replace the Webhook URL in your Trugen AI agent settings with the one generated by this workflow.
- **Prompting**: Use the provided HR screening prompt to define the candidate evaluation criteria.

## 🛠️ How to customize this workflow

- **Scoring Rules**: Adjust the AI logic to weigh specific skills or experience levels more heavily for certain roles.
- **Interview Flow**: Update the system message to add or remove screening questions as your hiring needs change.
- **ATS Integration**: Swap the Google Sheets node for a GreenHouse or Lever API node to sync data directly to your ATS.
- **Notifications**: Add a Slack alert to notify recruiters immediately when a "High-Fit" candidate completes their screen.
