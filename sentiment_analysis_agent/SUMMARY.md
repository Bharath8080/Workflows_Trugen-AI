# Create a sentiment analysis & CSAT video agent with GPT-4o-mini

This n8n template creates a high-performance Customer Experience (CX) agent designed for automated feedback collection. Optimized for **Trugen AI**'s low-latency voice and video interfaces, it captures user feedback with intelligent reasoning and deep sentiment analysis, providing immediate insights into customer satisfaction.

## 👥 Who is this for?

- **Product Managers** seeking real-time video feedback on new features or platform updates.
- **Customer Success Teams** wanting to automate CSAT and NPS collection at scale.
- **User Researchers** conducting automated qualitative interviews with visual sentiment analysis.
- **Service Businesses** aiming to benchmark emotional responses and interaction quality.

## 💡 What problem is this workflow solving?

Traditional feedback systems often struggle with:

- **Low Engagement**: Users find text-based surveys tedious and often ignore them.
- **Surface-Level Data**: Numerical ratings missing the "why" behind user frustration or delight.
- **Delayed Insights**: Manual analysis of recordings taking days or weeks to process.

This workflow solves these by using **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** to instantly analyze voice/video feedback, calculate CSAT scores (1-5), and identify actionable pain points and positive highlights in real-time.

## ⚙️ What this workflow does

- **Captures Feedback**: Receives interactive user voice/video transcriptions via a secure Webhook from Trugen AI.
- **Analyzes Sentiment**: Uses an AI Agent to evaluate the overall tone (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and detect specific emotions.
- **Benchmarks CSAT**: Assigns a numeric satisfaction score based on the user's verbal and tonal cues.
- **Derives Insights**: Automatically extracts key insights, pain points, and positive aspects mentioned during the interaction.
- **Logs CX Data**: Syncs all structured analysis results directly to **Google Sheets** for immediate dashboard reporting.
- **Unbiased Analysis**: Provides standardized, objective sentiment scoring across every user interaction.

## 🧰 Setup

- **OpenAI**: Connect your API key (optimized for GPT-4o-mini).
- **Google Workspace**: Enable and connect Google Sheets.
- **Database**: Update the `documentId` in the Google Sheets node to point to your CX/CSAT tracker.
- **Webhook**: Replace the Webhook URL in your Trugen AI agent settings with the one generated by this workflow.
- **Prompting**: Follow the "CustomerSatisfaction Description" guidelines in the workflow for high-quality data capture.

## 🛠️ How to customize this workflow

- **Metrics**: Update the LLM prompt to track specific metrics like NPS, Emotional Trust, or Brand Affinity.
- **Analysis Depth**: Refine the JSON schema in the Output Parser to extract industry-specific feedback categories.
- **Alerting**: Add email or Slack nodes to notify the support team whenever a "Highly Negative" sentiment is detected.
- **Segmentation**: Add logic to categorize feedback by user ID or product plan for deeper analysis.
